Few years ago, in India, there was a boy that everyone thought he was stupid. One day, the headmaster of his school eventually learnt about the rumors. He called the boy to his office and asked him to choose one from "2 rupees" and "5 rupees" and he can have it. The headmaster thought he would choose 5 rupees, but he chose the 2 rupees instead. He didn't ask why because he thought the boy was stupid just like everyone thought he was. The story then spread to the whole school, everyone keeps coming and testing him. And each time like that, he gets 2 rupees. One day, the headmaster noticed something was not right about him, so he called the boy and asked him "why did you choose 2 rupees instead of 5 one?". "If I had chosen the 5 rupees, no one would have given me more money. So I chose the 2 rupees because everyone would test me and I would gets more money from each test." He answered.
